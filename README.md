## Scutter CMS

Scutter CMS is a learning project of mine.

I will be running a few sites off it, my personal blog https://g33k.me a meme blog that shares products with the word “daddy” in them https://ohdaddy.fun and a site for Scutter CMS https://scuttercms.com



I have set aside some goals to accomplish.
- [x]Needs to linkable blog posts.
- [x]Needs a page to show a list of posts.
- [ ]Needs a simple edit page to add and edit posts.
- [ ]I want a page where I can upload images so I can add them in a post.
- [ ]Needs a way to add and edit pages. 
	- [ ]and to specify a type of page. I currently have two page types in mind, blog page or just a static page.
